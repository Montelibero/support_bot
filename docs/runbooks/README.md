# Runbooks

Runbooks describe repeatable operational procedures for common incidents.

## Recommended Structure

Each runbook should include:

1. **Symptoms**: what is observed
2. **Checks**: commands and signals to inspect
3. **Likely causes**: top hypotheses
4. **Recovery steps**: ordered actions
5. **Verification**: how to confirm recovery
6. **Follow-up**: preventive improvements
